# Sovralis

Sovralis is a groundbreaking project designed to serve as the vanguard of web3, focusing on providing a robust coordination layer for decentralized applications. This project is a grassroots initiative, launched anonymously to ensure that the focus remains on the technology and community rather than any individual or entity.

## Philosophy

The core philosophy of Sovralis is to empower the community through decentralization and anonymity. The project is built on the principles of transparency, openness, and community-driven development. No tokens will be sold; they can only be mined from the beginning by participating in the network, ensuring a fair and equitable distribution.

## First Release

The first release of Sovralis will introduce a coordination layer that will enable seamless interaction and collaboration between various decentralized applications. This layer will be the backbone of the Sovralis ecosystem, facilitating communication and data exchange between different nodes and networks.

## Participation

To participate in the Sovralis network and mine tokens, you will need to run a node and contribute to the network's security and stability. Details on how to set up a node and participate in the network will be available closer to the launch date.

Stay tuned for more updates and join the Sovralis community to be part of the future of web3.
